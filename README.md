# html-template

### Part 1: Create a menu
Show a menu with a number of menu items with different names.
The page itself shows Lorem Ipsum text. Each menu item has three sub-items.
### Part 2: Behavior of submenu
Clicking a sub-item shows an alert with the name of the menu item.
### Part 3: DOM mutation
Clicking a top-level menu item expands the sub-menu. Clicking it again collapses the sub-menu.
### Part 4: Create a sticky footer
Add a sticky footer to the bottom of the page. When the page content does not fill the full
viewport height, the footer should still be located at the bottom of the page. When the page
content becomes longer the footer is 'pushed down' so a user has to scroll down to see it.
